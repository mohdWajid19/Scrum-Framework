## The roles, their respective responsibilities, events, and artifacts involved in the Scrum framework :

    Roles:
        1. Product Owner: 
            Responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog, and ensuring that the team is working on the most valuable
            and high-priority items.

        3. Development Team: 
            Responsible for delivering the product increment during each Sprint. They are self-organizing and cross-functional, 
            with the skills needed to complete the work.

    Responsibilities:
        1. Product Owner:

        3. Development Team:
            - Plan and complete the work identified in the Sprint Backlog.
            - Ensure that the work meets the Definition of Done.
            - Collaborate with the Product Owner and Scrum Master to ensure that the product meets the needs of the users.

    Events:
        1. Sprint Planning: 
            A meeting where the team defines the Sprint Goal, selects the items from the product backlog to work on, and 
            creates a plan for the Sprint.
            
        2. Daily Scrum: 
            A short meeting where the team members share updates on their progress since the last meeting, and 
            plan their work for the day.
            
        3. Sprint Review: 
            A meeting where the team demonstrates the work completed during the Sprint and gets feedback from stakeholders.
            
        4. Sprint Retrospective: 
            A meeting where the team reflects on the Sprint and identifies areas for improvement.

    Artifacts:
        1. Product Backlog: 
            A prioritized list of all the work that needs to be done to complete the product.
            
        2. Sprint Backlog: 
            The subset of items from the product backlog that the team commits to completing during the Sprint.
            
        3. Increment: 
            The sum of all the completed items from the Sprint Backlog that meet the Definition of Done.


    Overall, the Scrum framework provides a flexible and iterative approach to software development, with clear roles, events, and 
    artifacts to guide the team through the process.

##  The completeProcedure of Scrum:
        1. Product Backlog Creation: 
            The Product Owner creates and maintains a prioritized list of features, functionality, and improvements that make up 
            the Product Backlog.
            
        2. Sprint Planning: 
            The team meets with the Product Owner to discuss the top items in the Product Backlog and selects the items 
            they will work on during the upcoming Sprint. They then create a Sprint Backlog, which is a list of items they will 
            deliver during the Sprint.
            
        3. Sprint Execution: 
            The team works on the items in the Sprint Backlog, collaborating daily to ensure they are making progress and 
            that any issues are being addressed. They also attend the Daily Scrum, a short meeting to discuss progress and 
            plan work for the day.
            
        4. Sprint Review: 
            At the end of the Sprint, the team presents their completed work to the Product Owner and other stakeholders, 
            demonstrating how the work meets the Definition of Done.
            
        5. Sprint Retrospective: 
            The team reflects on the Sprint and identifies what went well, what didn't go well, and how they can improve. 
            They then create a plan for implementing those improvements in the next Sprint.
            
        6. Product Backlog Refinement: 
            The Product Owner continually reviews and prioritizes the Product Backlog, making adjustments based on feedback and 
            changing priorities. The team collaborates with the Product Owner to clarify requirements and ensure the items are 
            ready to be worked on.
            
        7. Repeat: 
            The team continues to work through subsequent Sprints, using the feedback and lessons learned from each Sprint 
            to improve the process and deliver high-quality products.

    Throughout the Scrum process, the team is expected to be self-organizing and cross-functional, with each member contributing their 
    unique skills and expertise to the project. The Scrum Master facilitates the process, ensuring that the team is following the 
    Scrum framework and removing any obstacles that may prevent them from completing the work.
